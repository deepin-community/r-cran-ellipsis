This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-ellipsis package of ellipsis.  The
ellipsis package provides tools to work with '...' (ellipsis) arguments. It
was written by Hadley Wickham.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'ellipsis' to
'r-cran-ellipsis' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN)
packages for R.

    Package: ellipsis
    Version: 0.1.0
    Title: Tools for Working with ...
    Description: In S3 generics, it's useful to take ... so that methods can
        have additional argument. But this flexibility comes at a cost: misspelled
        arguments will be silently ignored. The ellipsis packages is an experiment
        that allows a generic to warn if any arguments passed in ... are not
        used.
